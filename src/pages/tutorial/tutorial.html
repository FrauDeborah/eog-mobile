Easyah is a tool for paying-it-forward. With it, you can collaborate with others who are also paying-it-forward, and maximize your impact.<br/><br/>

Quickly, there are a two concepts you need to understand to use Easyah.<br/><br/>

<ul>
	<li><b>Promises</b> / These are offers you make to do something for someone.<br/><br/></li>
	<li><b>Points</b> / These allow one person to ask another person to fulfill a promise they made.<br/><br/></li>
</ul>

So, in a nutshell, you create a profile, and then you search for Promises by other users who can help you. These Promises will require points.<br/><br/>

You earn points, primarily, by paying-it-forward, fulfilling your Promises for others. When you have earned enough points, you can make a request for a person to fulfill the Promise they made, for you.
